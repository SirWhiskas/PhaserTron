Creating a 2D Phaser (v2.7.7) game using ElectronJS (v3.0.5)

The art is from anzimuz's "GothicVania Cemetery" -> https://ansimuz.itch.io/gothicvania-cemetery

# Installation #
1.) After cloning this repo, run this command:

`npm install`


2.) Download anzimuz's "GothicVania Cemetery" asset pack (Although it's free, I do recommend donating because the art is amazing!)


3.) Copy-and-paste the contents within the assets folder from the download to the assets folder within this project. Here's the path from the download:
    
    gothicvania-cemetery-files/Phaser-code-gothicvania-cemetery/assets/
    
    
# Note #
Currently, the *index.html* and *game.js* files are the files included with anzimu's download. I'm using these files for testing with ElectronJS.
